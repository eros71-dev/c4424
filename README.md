# C4424 - A more light-hearted B3313 parody

Welcome to C4424! This mod takes a lighthearted approach to parodying the infamous B3313 hack, focusing on adding nostalgic references to old emulators and classic YouTube videos instead of turning the game into a generic creepypasta.

This mod doesn't attempt to follow the same concept like adding an immense amount of levels, but rather
""improve"" upon the existing game.

**This mod requires SM64CoopDX to run!**

## Features

We've had enough spooky beta, step aside B3313, what we need is some lighter-hearted stuff.

- Old Emulator References: Experience the joy of classic emulators like Project64 1.5 and it's
many issues!
- Classic YouTube References: Listen to some of the most well known YouTube songs, all royalty free!
- And some other new spins based on things like Vinesauce corruptions and whatnot.

## Installation

1. Download the mod from the releases tab.
2. Extract the mod folder into your game's `/mods` folder. (Usually located in %appdata%)
3. You're done! Make sure to check out the commands with **/c4424** in the chat.
