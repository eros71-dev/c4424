# C4424 - A more light-hearted B3313 parody

Welcome to C4424! This mod takes a lighthearted approach to parodying the infamous B3313 hack, focusing on adding nostalgic references to old emulators and classic YouTube videos instead of turning the game into a generic infinitely long creepypasta.

This mod doesn't attempt to follow the same concept like adding an immense amount of levels, but rather
""improve"" upon the existing game, although there's always room for possible extras, please don't expect a full romhack experience.

**This mod requires SM64CoopDX to run!**

## Features

We've had enough spo0ky beta, go home B3313, you're drunk.

- Old Emulator References: Experience the joy of classic emulators like Project64 1.6 and it's
many issues!
- Classic YouTube References: Listen to some of the most well known YouTube songs!
- And some other new changes based on things like Vinesauce corruptions and whatnot.

## Installation

1. Download the mod from the releases tab.
2. Extract the mod folder into your game's `/mods` folder. (Usually located in %appdata%)
3. You're done! Make sure to check out the C4424 settings in the pause menu. (Pressing R while paused.)


## Development

C4424 currently offers a work-in-progress API for custom music (loading custom songs, don't expect looping or anything fancy, at least just yet). Please check the source code to see how it's handled.

PRs for additional features or features are welcome, although this is a come-and-go project and you may have to wait for a while before we get back to you on your requests.

## Feedback and Support

We value your feedback and are committed to providing a POOP and DINNER experience. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please post it on the Issues tab.

## Disclaimer

This mod is intended for entertainment purposes only and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the creators of B3313 or any referenced emulators, YouTube videos, or internet personalities.

## TODO: Separate features in main.lua into possible separate lua files for better modularity and readability.
